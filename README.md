# League-of-Oldschool-Server
Server for League of Oldschool Client

**This project will not be continued until Gameserver of League Sandbox will be stable to catch start and end game events via socket**

## To run
- Run your mongodb service and be sure your port is 27017 and no password on localhost [You can download server here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community)
- Install all needed packages via `npm install`
- Run server via `npm start`, If it doesn't work try: `node server.js`

**Now you can register new account on the client and log in!**

**After championselect phase game will not start also cdn isn't implemented**
**In future client will have cdn implementation to download game and client updates and be in exe installer form**
